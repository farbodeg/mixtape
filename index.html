    <p><br><br>Tale as old as time<br>
True as it can be<br>
Barely even friends<br>
Then somebody bends<br>
Unexpectedly<br><br>
Just a little change<br>
Small to say the least<br>
Both a little scared<br>
Neither one prepared<br><br>
Beauty and the beast<br><br>
Ever just the same<br>
Ever a surprise<br>
Ever as before and ever just as sure as the sun will rise<br>
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)<br><br>

Ever a surprise<br>
Ever as before<br>
Ever just as sure<br>
As the sun will rise<br>
(Oh, oh, oh)<br><br>
Tale as old as time (ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>
Tune as old as song<br>
Bittersweet and strange<br>
Finding you can change<br>
Learning you were wrong<br><br>
Certain as the sun<br>
Certain as the sun<br>
Rising in the east<br>
Tale as old as time<br>
Song as old as rhyme<br>
Beauty and the beast<br><br>
Tale as old as time<br>

When things go wrong<br>
When the scent of her lingers<br>
And temptation's strong<br><br>
Cold, cold heart<br>
Hardened by you (oh)<br>
Some things lookin' better, baby<br>
Just passin' through (no, no, no, no, no)<br><br>
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time<br>
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find<br>
I'm not the man they think I am at home<br>
Oh no, no, no<br><br>
And this is what I should have said<br>
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid<br><br>

    <p><br><br>You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice<br>
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you<br>
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use<br><br>

And did you think this fool could never win?<br>
Well look at me, I'm coming back again<br>
I got a taste of love in a simple way<br>
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away<br><br>

And don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?<br>
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid<br>
And I'm still standing after all this time<br>
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind<br><br>

I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah<br><br>

Once I never could hope to win<br>
You starting down the road leaving me again<br>
The threats you made were meant to cut me down<br>
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now<br><br>

And don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?<br>
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid<br>
And I'm still standing after all this time<br>
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind<br><br>
